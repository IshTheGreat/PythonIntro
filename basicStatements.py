#Hey everyone, welcome to my channel, and most importantly, welcome to python!
#This video will teach you a couple of basic statemetents in python, check my other video to learn how to dowload a text editor to type and run python code! 
#It will be in the description!

print("Hello World") #This sentence is called the print statement, you say print, then parenthisis and enter something
                    # in the quatiation marks!
print("HI Everyone!!!") #Lets run this now! Look at the bottom of the screen, the thing hilighted in blue!

#LETS talk about variables!
#Syntax = variable name = variable value
var = "python is amazing" #var is the variable name, and the STR python is amazing is the str!
                          #a string or STR is like a sentence that is put in "". STR's are data types
print(var)                #Ok guys can you tell me what would be shown in the terminal when I run this program??
#Lets run this! If you guys guessed that it was gonna print my str that i defined the variable var from in the prior line!

#Now, you guys might me guessing, why am I adding hashtags before every sentence that I type! Well these are called comments!
#Comments are pieces of code that are not read when the system reads a file!

#Whatever I type, the system wont read!

THANK YOU for watching Python Intro, I will add a gitub link to these lines of code in the description,
    See u later
BYE!!!!
